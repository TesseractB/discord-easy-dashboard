# Theming

Using themes that are not one of the default is quite easy. To use one, see the below steps.

1. Find a theme you like in [the themes page](themes/readme.md)
2. Download the theme's `.zip` file
3. Extract said `.zip` file into `node_modules/discord-easy-dashboard/themes`
4. In the config, add (or change) `theme: theme-folder-name`
5. Voil√†! You are now using the new theme.
